# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior in a telecom company.  
The goal is to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and to uncover actionable insights that can help reduce attrition.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Main Analysis Areas**:
  - Customer demographics and churn rates
  - Service plans and contract types
  - Monthly charges and payment methods
  - City-wise churn distribution

## Key Findings
- Contract type and monthly charges have a strong relationship with churn.
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Certain cities showed higher churn rates than others.

## Next Steps
- Build a predictive churn model using machine learning (optional future work).
- Propose strategies for improving customer retention based on the findings.
